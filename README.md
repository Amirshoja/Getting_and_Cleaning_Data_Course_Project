2-  Load test datasets
3-  Create a data frame for the test subjects
4-  Create a data frame for the test activities
5-  Assign the activity labels
6-  Create a data frame for the test measurements
7-  Extract only mean and std values
8-  Assign the measurement labels
9-  Create dataset for the test data
10- Load train datasets
11- Create a data frame for the train subjects
12- Create a data frame for the train activities
13- Assign the activity labels
14- Create a data frame for the train measurements
15- Extract only mean and std values
16- Assign the measurement labels
17- Create dataset for the train data
18- Merge the test and train datasets
19- Calculate measurement averages
20- Create the tidy dataset

#The tidy dataset can be found in the file tidy_dataset.csv
